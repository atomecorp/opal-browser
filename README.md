Opal-Browser - Client side web development in pure Ruby, using Opal
===================================================================

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/opal-browser.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/opal-browser)
[![Code Climate](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/maintainability-percentage/opal/opal-browser.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/opal/opal-browser)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/opal/opal-browser/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opal/opal-browser/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

This library aims to be a full-blown wrapper for all the browser API as defined by
HTML5.

It provides a very JQuery-like interface to DOM, but itself it doesn't use nor
require JQuery nor opal-jquery (which is an alternative library for interfacing
the web browser). The main difference though is that Opal-Browser goes far beyond
what JQuery does.

Usage
=====

_Gemfile_

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org/'

gem 'opal-browser'
```

_Server side (config.ru, Rakefile, Rails, Sinatra, Roda, etc. - not needed for static compilation)_

```ruby
require 'opal-browser'
# Your server code here
```

_Browser side_

```ruby
require 'opal'
require 'native'
require 'promise'
require 'browser/setup/full'

# Your Opal code here
$document.body << "Hello world!"
```

_Static Compile Opal + Opal-Browser library_

```bash
bundle exec opal -c -q opal-browser -p native -p promise -p browser/setup/full -e '#' -E > opal-browser.js
```

_Static Compile your application_

```bash
bundle exec opal -Oc -s opal -s native -s promise -s browser/setup/full app/application.rb > application.js
```

_And load it in HTML!_

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Application</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src='opal-browser.js' onload='Opal.require("native"); Opal.require("promise"); Opal.require("browser/setup/full");'></script>
  <script src='application.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```

See the examples/integrations/ directory for various ideas on how to quickly start
development using opal-browser.

Features
========
This is a list of many currently wrapped features and some details on them.

DOM
---
DOM support is complete as far as I know, it has a very Nokogiri feel to it
with obvious differences where relevant (for instance, event handling).

```ruby
$document.ready do
  alert "yo dawg, I'm all loaded up in here"
end
```

It also supports a markaby inspired builder DSL (using Paggio) which generates
DOM nodes directly instead of creating a string.

```ruby
$document.ready do
  DOM {
    div.info {
      span.red "I'm all cooked up."
    }
  }.append_to($document.body)
end
```

Events
------

Add an event to a given element:

```ruby
$document.at_css("button").on(:click) do |e|
  e.prevent # Prevent the default action (eg. form submission)
  alert "Button clicked!"
end
```

Or add it to a parent element and use a delegator, so that an event gets fired
when any button children of `$document` is clicked:

```ruby
$document.on(:click, "button") do |e|
  e.prevent
  # e.on is a button that has been clicked
  e.on.inner_text = "Clicked!"
end
```

Run an event once with `#one` instead of `#on`, or disable an event with `#off`.

CSSOM
-----
CSSOM support (using Paggio) is still incomplete but the useful parts are
implemented, this includes a DSL for generating a CSS style and the same DSL
is also used to change style declarations (which can either belong to a
`DOM::Element` or a `CSS::Rule::Style`).

```ruby
$document.body.style.apply {
  background color: 'black'
  color 'white'
  font family: 'Verdana'
}
```

AJAX & SJAX
-----------
The `XMLHttpRequest` API has been wrapped completely, it also optionally
supports binary results as typed-arrays.

It easily allows for synchronous and asynchronous requests.

```ruby
require 'browser/http'

Browser::HTTP.get "/something.json" do
  on :success do |res|
    alert res.json.inspect
  end
end
```

WebSocket
---------
Websockets have been fully wrapped and they are easily configurable with
blocks.

```ruby
require 'browser/socket'

Browser::Socket.new 'ws://echo.websocket.org' do
  on :open do
    every 1 do
      puts "ping"
    end
  end

  on :message do |e|
    log "Received #{e.data}"
  end
end
```

EventSource
-----------
Event sources have been implemented and are easily configurable with blocks.

```ruby
require 'browser/event_source'

Browser::EventSource.new '/events' do |es|
  es.on :message do |e|
    alert e.data
  end

  es.on :custom do |e|
    alert "custom #{e.data}"
  end
end
```

History
-------
The HTML5 History API has been fully wrapped.

Storage
-------
The HTML5 Storage API has been wrapped and it exports a single Storage class
that uses the most appropriate and available API to store data locally.

```ruby
require 'browser/storage'

$storage = $window.storage
$storage[:hello] = "world"
```

Database SQL
------------
WebSQL has been fully wrapped (Chromium-only)

```ruby
require 'browser/database/sql'

db = Browser::Database::SQL.new 'test'
db.transaction {|t|
  t.query('CREATE TABLE test(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC, text TEXT)').then {
    t.query('INSERT INTO test (id, text) VALUES(?, ?)', 1, 'huehue')
  }.then {
    t.query('INSERT INTO test (id, text) VALUES(?, ?)', 2, 'jajaja')
  }.then {
    t.query('SELECT * FROM test')
  }.then {|r|
    r.each {|row|
      alert row.inspect
    }
  }
}
```

Browser support
===============

* Edge (Current - 3) to Current
* Firefox (Current - 3) to Current
* Chrome (Current - 3) to Current
* Safari (Current - 3) to Current
* Opera (Current - 3) to Current

Any problem above browsers should be considered and reported as a bug.

(Current - 3) to Current denotes that we support the current major stable version
of the browser and 3 versions preceding it. For example, if the current version
of a browser is 24.x, we support all versions between 21.x to 24.x.

We will accept compatibility patches for even earlier browser versions. Opal-Browser
is written in such a way, that it integrates a robust compatibility check system,
similar to Modernizr, and the history of this library goes even as far as supporting
Internet Explorer 6.

See the [polyfills documentation](docs/polyfills.md) if you wish to polyfill some
behaviors not supported by the ancient web browsers (like `querySelectorAll`).
